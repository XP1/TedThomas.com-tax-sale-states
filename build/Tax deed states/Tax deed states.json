As an investor, this is not something to concern you. When you buy in tax deed states, you get the property. In Arkansas, you get the property\u00a0for a fraction of the real value.Looking over the list from the state tax office shows every county has something to sell. In Sebastian County, the property at 4610 N. 35th St., Ft. Smith, has a listed value of $64,050. The past-due taxes are $7,680, or a bit over 10% of the tax-assessed value. The real estate guide website Zillow puts the value at $85,000. Which is correct? Remember, tax assessors will often set the value a bit low to avoid being hauled into court to justify their number. Regardless, investing $7,680 to get a property worth at least $70,000 certainly leads to a big profit.Over in Perry County, 10 acres of farmland\u00a0with another 2.5 acres of timber had past-due taxes of $435.08. It is worth about $2,000. Making this even better, standing timber prices\u00a0are high right, making the trees a real value.",
