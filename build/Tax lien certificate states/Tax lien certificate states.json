The other property he spent $5,000 on and wound up owning the home.The key to making a big profit quickly is to buy property that has a high chance of being redeemed.

The Zillow estimated price is $21,000 and the website says the owner can expect to earn $675 a month in rent. That comes out to $8,100 per year. Figuring in taxes and other associated costs, even if you had to borrow the $15,632 to buy it, you would pay off the loan in under three years.

What set this sale apart from the usual sale in tax lien states is way the properties were sold; it was not a tax lien. Mississippi is a tax lien state, but these properties were not sold at the lien sale, says the news report in the Sun Herald newspaper.Another unusual fact about this sale is a \u201cbuy it now\u201d feature.

These are state-owned properties that did not sell in the regular tax lien auction.Many of the properties are vacant lots. You may wonder what use is buying a vacant lot. Since you get the property in this sale, you can resell it to the next door neighbor. The neighbor can expand his yard for a fraction of the price of buying the lot on the open market. As these properties list at a \u201cbuy it now\u201d price of around 10 percent, you can buy the land and ask double what you paid. The neighbor gets a bigger yard for about 20% of the open market cost.Some of the properties are homes. The second one in the list, 6107 Walnut Dr, Pearlington, MS, is a mobile home with an estimated value of $35,000 according to Zillow and $32,000 according to the tax collector. Either way, with a purchase price of $3,781, it represents a deal. Zillow said you could rent the home, which is close to the Gulf of Mexico, for around $900 a month.

In Hall County\u2019s\u00a02021 sale notice, some of the property listed was for retail stores. A 3-bay shopping center at 2921 W HWY 30, Kearny, was listed with a past-due amount of $14,008.32.\u00a0The shopping center is worth more than $700,000. Under the\u00a0terms of the Nebraska sale, an investor earns 14%, nearly $2,000 per year, a big profit.\u00a0When you are investing in a tax lien, the property is less important than the chance the owner will redeem the property. In this case, in Hall County, the owner is going to redeem the taxes in order to keep the profitable commercial buildings and the businesses in those buildings. On the other side, the chance of the owner redeeming a house that is destroyed by a fire or natural disaster is much lower. Look at it this way every time you invest in a tax lien. Are you willing to own the property? If the answer is yes, buy it. If the answer is no, go to the next property on the\u00a0list. It\u2019s always important to do your homework before you buy. Start doing your homework today by taking this\u00a0free course\u00a0from Ted Thomas. Is tax lien investing for you? This course will answer that question for you and only take about an hour of your time.",

The decisions sometimes fine-tune the process, but the sales go on.In April 2020, the New Hampshire Supreme Court handed down a ruling about a tax sale in Bedford. The city sold a house in a tax sale for about $83,000 more than the past-due taxes. That $83K was considered a profit for the City of Bedford. The\u00a0Union Leader\u00a0newspaper covered the case. The New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled the tax sale is certainly legal. However, the City of Bedford is not allowed to keep the excess or overbid on the property. That has to go to the property owner. The city is only allowed to collect the past-due taxes and the interest allowed to the city under state law.\u00a0A lot of people wonder if this means investors cannot make a profit. Investors in a New Hampshire tax sale are still allowed to make a profit. Only the cities cannot make a profit.

The average home cost in Canton is around $149,000, so a few thousand dollars for a lot to build a home on sounds reasonable.

A check on Zillow shows a small, but attractive, home with an\u00a0estimated value\u00a0of $17,000.\u00a0Realtor.com\u00a0puts the value at $48,000. With a price disparity that high, this property bears more investigation before bidding.1449 Gross Ave. N.E. in Canton started out at $11,070.54 and the winning bid was $20,500. Realtor.com and Zillow differ on the value. Realtor says it is\u00a0worth about $38,000\u00a0and Zillow says\u00a0about $16,000.
